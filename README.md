![logo image](https://github.com/Twela/textureshader-exporter/blob/main/images/txtshader.png?raw=true)

A blender addon which exports textures and shaders into a p3xml file, which can be imported into the P3D editor!

**Requires Blender version 2.93.x**

I say requires. It's not been tested on anything lower. So just be keep that in mind if using an older version

## Features
- Mass texture and shader export into a p3dxml file
- Shader customization on export
- An option to export both, only texutres or only shaders

## To do
- Individual shader customzation
